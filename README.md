# AngularJs-Learnings

This is a sample project where I tried my hand at learning AngularJs with an ASP.NET web app.
I started off with a the default MVC web application on Visual Studio 2013, hence it would have all the default template with the standard pages and controllers.

Stuff what I have added to this project:

1. Controllers\DeviceController.cs : Gives me some REST endpoints for the angular app
2. All the javascript files in Scripts\AppLib
3. Views\Home\Device.cshtml

Access the first page from the URL http://localhost:51465/home/device

It is just a simple grid with add/edit functionality using AngularJs concepts.
